## Marc Reardon | Library
Store books like a library with this simple yet elegant application.

Functions available:
  - Add books to the library
  - Remove books from the library
  - Modify any value in the library
  - Print the whole library
  
Design Process:

  Originally, I used mySQL for the DB and it was super simple. Heroku doesn't work well with mySQL though, so I switched to postgreSQL.
